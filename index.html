        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to utilize a fitness API to provide users with detailed information on their fitness progress and manage their workouts. I am creating a Web Application that will involve pulling data directly from an API in order to display this data in a user-friendly way and so it can be used effectively to assist users with tracking and managing their workouts. The idea is to provide a product that can act as a tool for fitness enthusiasts and newcomers to this area. The project will provide functionality for users to log in and out and have the ability to read and favourite workout plans provided by the app. They will be able to create a personal profile that will share their workout progress and will be able to search and add friends to share these accomplishments with.</p>
